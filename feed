		  <p>There is something inherently satisfying about walking into your garden and harvesting fresh gourmet mushrooms for your next meal. Growing mushrooms outdoors in garden beds is low maintenance, produces quality food and provides a unique and beautiful addition to your yard. Many different species can be grown outdoors, but i am going to highlight one of our favorites: the king oyster. <img style="max-width: 40%; margin: 5px;" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1518967396639-378a1dcc96d5?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MXxzZWFyY2h8MzE5fHxncm93aW5nLW11c2hyb29tcy1vdXRzaWRlfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyMjE3NjgzMw\u0026ixlib=rb-1.2.1" alt="grow+bed" align="right" /> King oyster mushrooms can be vastly different depending on growing conditions.</p>
<p>The morel habitat kit is meant for outdoor use. It&amp;rsquo;s designed to be grown directly in soil, and you need about four to five square feet of ground (like a small raised bed ). Morels are a perennial crop and will continue to produce fungi year after year if the appropriate conditions are provided. You can get started anytime the soil is workable, which depends on your climate. The kit includes a bag of inoculated california mushroom spawn and a set of growing instructions.</p>
<p>The blue oyster mushroom usually colonizes its growing media quickly. They are a cold-weather variant of the pearl oyster mushroom, pleurotus ostreatus, and grow in temperatures from 45-65 degrees fahrenheit, although they do not fruit heavily unless it&amp;rsquo;s around 60 degrees. They like lots of fresh air to develop their large caps, which means that they can perform well outdoors. The non-blue variation of this species is widely grown throughout asia and is used heavily in chinese, japanese, and korean cooking, but the columbinus variety is very similar in flavor and texture to its whitish namesake.</p>
<p>In the mushroom growing process, agaricus starter culture (spawn) is worked into the mushroom substrate (compost following pasteurization) and allowed to grow throughout the substrate for 14 days. After colonization of agaricus mycelia in the substrate is complete, a 1. 5-inch layer called casing, consisting of peat soil amended with calcium carbonate (to neutralize ph) and water (about 80 percent moisture), is applied on top of the compost bed. This layer is called.</p>
<h2>Growing Oyster Mushrooms Outside</h2>
<p>Mushroom growing kits - grow gourmet mushrooms grow: shiitake mushrooms, oyster mushrooms (pleurotus), pom pom blanc (hericium) mushrooms, morel mushrooms organic mushroom spawn&amp;nbsp;used to seed these logs is certified organic by quality assurance international (qai). <img style="max-width: 20%; margin: 4px;" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1516161443683-c48aa2f44ed7?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MXxzZWFyY2h8MzIyfHxncm93aW5nLW11c2hyb29tcy1vbi1sb2dzfGVufDB8fHx8MTYyMjE3NTc5OQ\u0026ixlib=rb-1.2.1" alt="spawn" align="right" /> Mushroom logs produced through methods that integrate cultural, biological, and mechanical practices that foster cycling of resources, promote ecological balance, and conserve biodiversity. All components of our&amp;nbsp; mushroom growing kits are recyclable as are all materials used to pack.</p>
<p>Growing oyster mushrooms doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be complicated. Sure it&amp;rsquo;s fun to have a highly controlled grow room, to monitor the environment and to try and optimize to perfection things like humidity, temperature and fresh air. But sometimes, we just want to grow some mushrooms. And i can&amp;rsquo;t think of a better way to do that than to grow oyster mushrooms outside using the straw log method.</p>
<p>Another good method for big-time mushroom production is creating mulch mushroom beds. These can be done as garden paths or actual garden beds, with the mushrooms popping up under the kale and chard. Oyster mushrooms are especially good for this approach. Sourcing materials: growing your own mushrooms in mulch is possibly the easiest way to do it. You&amp;rsquo;ll need cardboard boxes, hardwood mulch, oyster mushroom grain spawn, and water. The cardboard boxes should not have shiny surfaces, the hardwood mulch/chips should be fresh, and the water is better if hasn&amp;rsquo;t been treated (rain, stream, pond, or lake rather than municipal).</p>
<p>First of all, pick a mushroom variety. Mushroom growing beginners are advised to choose&amp;nbsp;button and oyster mushrooms. But if you want, and prefer, morrel and shiitake mushrooms, then you&amp;rsquo;d better be up for the challenge.</p>

Growing your own portabellas is easy! blue oyster mushrooms, which many say taste like chicken, are a favorite, as are lion&amp;rsquo;s mane mushrooms, which have a light, delicate, seafood-like taste similar to scallops. Some consider lion&amp;rsquo;s mane mushrooms to be a &amp;ldquo;foolproof fungus&amp;rdquo;.</p>
<p>Back to top wild morel mushrooms (morchella spp. ) are a favorite among chefs and dining connoisseurs who crave the delicious meaty flavor. There are as many as 70 species in the genus, but the ones more commonly gathered in the wild are the black morel (morchella elata), the common morel (morchella esculenta), and the late morel (morchella deliciosa). Hunting for morel mushrooms in the spring becomes a sort of mythical quest for those who crave these forest dwellers.

Some of these traditional methods include growing mushrooms on logs. When planting outdoors on logs, it&amp;rsquo;s recommended to purchase dowels that have been impregnated with mushroom spawn, also known as mycelium. When choosing a log or preparing one, look for a log that has fallen in the dormant season or if cutting your own log, be sure to cut during the dormant season (dormant season is between when the leaves fall off and regrow in the spring).</p>

On the other hand, there are other species which can grow easily outdoors.</p>

<p>Crumble and stomp pick up a convenient amount of spent substrate at the helsieni farm in kera. If you have a growkit you can add its contents as well (after harvesting your mushrooms). Remove any green mould if you see some and put it in the compost or biowaste. Crumble the spent substrate into pieces &amp;ndash; the smaller the better.
